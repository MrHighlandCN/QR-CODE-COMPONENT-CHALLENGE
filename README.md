# Frontend Mentor Challenges

This repository contains my solutions to various [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges.  
The purpose of this repo is to practice and improve my frontend development skills using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** (and sometimes frameworks like React or TailwindCSS).
